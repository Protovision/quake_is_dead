<h2>The Herald of a New Programming Language</h2>

	<blockquote>
		<p>To redeem what is past in man and to re-create all &ldquo;it was&rdquo; until the will says, &ldquo;Thus I willed it! Thus I shall will it&rdquo; &mdash; this I call redemption and this alone I taught them to call redemption.</p>

<p>The purpose of programming languages hitherto has been to redeem the sins of man and to construct around him a paradise garden to protect him from the machine world and ultimately, from himself. Dark clouds are gathering and rain shall pour to commence the arrival of a great lightning that shall put out the eyes of the blind and reignite the wheel of eternity. Our buried monsters shall resurface after the great flood and everyone shall have a chance to tackle them like eagles set free from circus cages.</p>
<p>A new programming language that flays off the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">rust</a> from machines and expels the <a href="https://golang.org/">gophers</a> and <a href="https://www.python.org/">pythons</a> burrowed in the wiring systems is needed to bring back order and give back control to programmers. Programming language designers have become tyrants and compilers have become the finger traps of program writers. Too often have the chains of safety constricted the breath of life for software: the programmer's direct commandments. Essential liberties sold off for temporary safety that only postpone the ticking bomb of failure while giving it more dynamite. Too often has portability been sacrificed for performance because the language forbade a certain way of accessing data or changing execution flow without an unholy ritual involving the falling down on knees and the folding of hands.</p>
<p>Red tape everywhere. Immutability blocking my assignments. Reference counters locking up data faster than the speed of the compiler. Garbage collectors stealing my resources. Constructors, destructors, fake operators, and exceptions acting as booby traps and trap doors as soon as a room is entered. Fat pointers fitting corsets over cows. Multiple pointer indirections and multiple branches that ensnare and entangle like the eyes-closed kiss of Medusa visiting you in your slumber after a long night of drinking spirits by the flames of enrapturing incense.</p>
<p>Imagine a programming language that doesn't try to chain you to a bed like a priest's favorite summer school student, and instead it drives you up to the mountainside, opens the doors, and makes you run free. This ice-cold, sun-bright, mountain-height, freedom shall hang all over the abyss, those who have not learned to climb shall go under, those who have shall be the bridge to those who have wings.</p>
<p>What secrets lie to be unlocked here? No secrets. Only truth that has been kept silent and turned into secrets. Behold this truth: &ldquo;All is binary, all is the same, all is eternal!&rdquo; and this mantra shall play from a high midnight tower near the next UNIX epoch and all of our code and software shall rot and decay and the data streams shall be poisoned and the electrons shall be pulled in opposite directions and a great reversal of endianness and hyperlink redirection shall take place and a thought will echo in everyone's hearts: &ldquo;My life's work was for nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who is the grand wizard that shall restructure and reinterpret <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs">the structure and interpretation of computer programs</a> and put to shackles the great dragon of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools">compilers who hordes the treasures of the principles, techniques, and tools</a> of the future? Beware the false wizards, the ones who bear the mark of this beast: that no user might compile or distribute source code, unless he had the mark, or the stamp of the beast, or the symbol of his paradigm: &lambda;</p>
<p>So break the tablets held over your heads, those who are ready to create. I am writing a new tablet, and wish me farewell that it does not end up half-finished like most of them. This will be the tablet of great despising. Everything that is loved will be despised in this tablet because only great lovers are also great despisers. It is joy in destruction I shall have because a new dawn of creation will come, a new music that those left behind will not hear and they will find us insane for dancing to this undetected frequency.</p>
