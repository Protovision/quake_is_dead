	<blockquote>
		<p>If it is <i>possible</i> to think of the world as a determinate magnitude of force, as a determinate number of centres of force &ndash; and every other idea remains indeterminate and therefore <i>useless</i> &ndash; then it follows that it must go through a calculable number of combinations, in the great game of chance that is its existence. If an infinite amount of time has elapsed, then at some moment or other every possible combination must have been realized; and what is more, it would have been realized an infinite number of times. And since every other possible combination must have come and gone between each of these &lsquo;combinations&rsquo; and its next &lsquo;recurrence&rsquo;, and each of these combinations conditions the entire sequence of combinations in the same series, a cycle of absolutely identical series is thus demonstrated. The world is a cycle which has already been repeated an infinite number of times and plays its game <i>in infinitum</i>.</p>

<p>The literal truth of the eternal recurrence, originally created by the Ancients and unconsealed by Nietzsche, could very well hold under certain conditions, all of which conditions express the finiteness of almost everything from matter, to energy, to space; but time, must be without end. The infinite being of time is said to be demonstrated as a consequence of perpetual change and development: the never realized state of affairs that is our world. Hence, there is no such thing as progress: only transformation that consists in repeatedly dying and being reborn. Hence there is no being at all besides time.</p>
<p>The practical effects of this truth: the life-affirming stimulant for the ascendant and the death-affirming cure for the declining. Reasons to keep or spread this message are the same reasons one will come by if proof of God is ever secretly found. Happiness consists in ignorance and pure self-deception, yay, one's very survival requires it. Disregarding the contradiction and embarassment to God's power if he could be &ldquo;proven&rdquo; to mortals, I shall lay out the consequences of revealing such a proof. Consequences if proven false: all the holy works done by the christians and the muslims will be in vain, their grand purpose in this life and the next is gone, nothing is left for their existence, abortion before euthanasia shall be the the next act for the most devout. Not only this, but every &lsquo;thou shalt&rsquo; is no longer applicable and no new moral principles can be established except on the basis of <i>will to power</i>. There shall be no limit to what humans are allowed to do. Permission is granted by strength alone. Politics becomes obsolete: discussion, arguments, and compromises for the sake of justice, freedom, and equality become unnecessary when firepower ultimately decides who gets what for no reasons other than &lsquo;I want it and I will take it because I can&rsquo;. And such a mantra will have no eternal consequences because you only live once. Every society will be mob rule or military rule. No concept of rights shall exists for either. There will no longer be good or evil acts: just business as usual. Human life will be no more significant than that of the lowest worm. Humanity shall be split in multiple levels of oppression between organized groups of power. The most enslaved will only be kept alive just barely enough for their labor while enjoying nothing from what they produce.</p>
<p>If God is proven true: not much better than the former situation. The result is actually more slaves and fewer, more concentrated groups of power who maintain greater control and greater oppression to a greater number of people. Politics again comes to an end: humans no longer have any right to structure their societies, let alone their own lives because man is incapable of making just laws for himself outside of biblical commands. All claims to good and evil cannot be made unless it come from a representative of God or God himself. The distance between the lowest and most ascendant members of societies are actually larger than the former case. Slaves are maintained as slaves primarily by deception: they do not realize they are slaves and are actually happy with their lot and all cases of oppression are rationalized as being tests from God or temptations from the devil. Primary virtues for the slaves involve the absence of dominance or potential self-harm in all forms, from conduct to diet to aesthetics: patience, impartiality, resignation, sobriety, chastity, veganism, minimalism, environmentalism (all have in common the taking in of as little as possible while enjoying or expending as little as possible). Meanwhile the representatives of God privately engage in all kinds of squandery, drunkenness, fornication, and other sacriligious acts while feasting off the labor of the workers and redistributing the scraps to them under a sort of socialist or communist policy that is compatible with what God's earthly government would be like.</p>
<p>Who is strong enough to live in either world? Uncertainty is a luxury that keeps things from collapsing into despotism. And shall we review the consequences of the certainties revolving around the eternal return?</p>
<p>What are the consequences of knowing the magnitudes of matter, space, energy, and time? The eternal return places matter, space, and energy as finite while time being infinite. Every moment is configured by a combination of matter and energy in finite space. Given infinite time, does a single configuration appear at least twice? And if so, what prevents it from appearing an infinite number of times in this infinite timeline and what prevents these infinite appearances from causing an infinitely repeating sequence of multi-nested sequences? What counterarguments exist other than the supposed belief in an infinitely precise space where entities can take on incalculable positions in seemingly bounded space: that the space between space can always be divided by two with infinite precision and infinite uncertainty in measurement? Such a counterargument makes these intrinsic uncertainties in space itself as the seed for all never-the-same becoming of existence and of a therefore infinite progression and never-ending perfection of history: the formula for pantheism as well as many &lsquo;progressive&rsquo; political religions that are fundamentally no different from their non-secular enemies. We can trace the arguments for this belief back to Zeno's paradoxes whose common themes involve the ability to divide any distance in half <i>ad infinitum</i> which leads to the paradox of infinite space inside of any enclosed space and thus to Zeno's conclusion that no distance is ever truly traversed and no motion ever actually occurs anywhere: but does this mean that all is being and becoming is an illusion, in which case it contradicts any notion of progress in any state of affairs; the world is already completed and nothing that happens is significant. Zeno's paradoxes go against common sense, it is seen everywhere all the time that objects travel past distance marks and it is possible regardless of how many smaller distances lie in between; this proves <i>a posteriori</i> that either space is not a continuum or that entities in space have the ability to teleport between fundamental units of space at any given time. If the latter is the case, then it also implies that either time is not a continuum, meaning there is a fundamental <i>distance</i> between two points in time, or there is an intermission from change at regular intervals as time passes. There is also the mathematical definition that dividing anything by infinity equals zero or the equivalent statement: infinity cannot fit inside of something that is finite.</p>
<p>So, for the sake of encompassing and reconciling all doctines, no matter how seemingly contradictory, we can still say that there are infinite positions, by virtue of their precision, in space while still restraining space to a closed volume, along with conserved matter and energy and yet the eternal return can still hold simply because certain quantities between two quantitative points are either skipped or not allowed to manifest in any one of the domains of space, matter, energy, or time. Everything in at least one of these domains are <i>quantized</i> even though there are theoretical values that are either calculable or conceivable yet never encountered from a measurement. Motion does not necessarily consist of visiting every possible or conceivable position between two points, there could be a &lsquo;jump&rsquo; between two points of minimum distance that is the converged sum of all the smaller distances. Indeed, without this jump there would really be no motion and the conclusion of Zeno's paradoxes would be true. But because it is not and because there really is a finite number of points of space within a finite space, and because this principle of quantization also applies to energy and matter, then, under the condition that there is a principle of infinity for time, history literally repeats itself forever.</p>
<p>Becomingness is conditioned on quantization, but it's eternality of creation and destruction is dependent on the beingness of time. Time may actually not move at all, or that it moves in such a way as described by Zeno's paradox, not a single time point is ever reached no matter how close it is to the present; time is the only true continuum and thus it is the only thing that is truly eternal. There is no beginning or end of time.</p>
<p>The pantheistic theme conditioned on Zeno's paradox has it's underlying spiritual impulses as cause:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>The old habit of thinking of things in the light of their purposes, of thinking of the world in terms of divine creation and guidance, is so powerful that the thinker has to be careful not to think that the world&rsquo;s very failure to achieve any purpose is itself intentional. This idea &ndash; that the world intentionally <i>evades</i> achieving any purpose and even devises expedients to avoid falling into a cycle &ndash; inevitably occurs to all those who would like to insist upon the world&rsquo;s <i>boundless capacity for innovation</i>, in other words, the finite, determinate energy of invariable magnitude that is &lsquo;the world&rsquo; possesses the wondrous facility for <i>infinitely</i> reconfiguring its forms and states. The world is supposed to be capable of divine creative power, an infinite power of transformation, even if God no longer is; it is supposed to <i>prevent</i> itself of its own accord from falling back into one of its earlier forms; it is supposed to have not only the intention, but also the <i>means</i> of guarding itself from any repetition; and thus at every moment it is supposed to <i>monitor</i> each of its movements to avoid achieving any purposes, arriving at any final states, or initiating any repetitions &ndash; and whatever else may follow from such inexcusably preposterous reasoning and wishful thinking. This is just the persistence of the earlier religious reasoning and wishful thinking, a kind of longing to believe that somewhere or other, in <i>some way or other</i>, the world is the same as the old, beloved, infinite and limitlessly creative God after all &ndash; that in some way or other &lsquo;the old God still lives&rsquo; after all.</p>

<p>But we still have to consider the premise of the closedness of space for the eternal return to hold. Sure we have the quantization and conservation of matter and energy, but is it not possible for them to disperse and drift apart in boundless space, never to meet again? Shall this eternal dispersement and lack of interaction between entities in space be the end of history? If there is an end, does this imply there was a beginning? To prevent this, what necessarily points to the closedness of space or are these systems always in an oscillating unity within infinite space and they never drift apart?</p>
