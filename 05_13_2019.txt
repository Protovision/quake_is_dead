<h1>May days</h1>
<p>I'm still currently working on implementing my own webassembly interpreter. The process seems to be a never ending circle: first I write a lot of code, then I delete all of it because I come up with a better idea or I stumble on a new requirement which the previous code cannot handle. The webassembly specification mocks my intellegence because all the semantics are there including the algorithms for validation and execution in a formal mathematical notation yet I still struggle to translate it into neat and organized C++ code. I have never made a compiler before, but if I ever manage to create a program to translate webassembly text into web assembly binary and execute it, then I would like to make my own programming language that compiles to webassembly.</p>
<p>I have taken breaks by playing more video games only to uninstall them after being reminded of their dire flaws which I have covered in previous posts. Peeking on reddit, I see the masses make complaints about the games I play, though not for the same reasons. They often complain about non-issues like lack of skins for their favorite characters or typos in the UI, but sometimes people bring up real issues like performance issues and matchmaking issues. The dumbest suggestion I've seen from a reddit user, particularly for Quake Champions, is a call for us to spend more money on that game so that the devs can make the game better. I never believed that throwing more money at something will make it better, whatever it is. The same goes for early access games. If the product is good, I will spend money into it, but spending to invest in it's development is only a smart idea if one can yield a dividend for oneself from it; otherwise, it's just throwing money away.</p>
<p>Back in the old days, video game companies released fully completed video games before consumers would purchase them. Now consumers have been duped into things like <q>Games as a service</q> model, one of the earliest examples include WoW subscriptions. Users also are now falling for something I call <q>Game development as a fundraiser</q> which asks people to fund the development of a game with no real promise that it will ever be completed, this latter case is often coupled with the release of an <q>early access</q> game that is riddled with bugs and performance issues but may sometimes try to make users forget about these real issues by releasing cute or sexually appealing skins and fluffing the patch notes with what may look like bug fixes and performance fixes but are actually just filler text with things like <q>Fixed a spelling error with this UI button</q>, <q>Fixed the font spacing around the letters for this language</q>, or <q>Adjusted the volume for this sound effect</q>. So they make it look like they are getting things done while the game still remains unplayable over 60 fps for anyone without a $2000 PC.</p>
<p>For these reasons, I have taken breaks from the video games which were originally supposed to be breaks from the programming. The breaks of my breaks include reading books that are hundreds of years old on philosophy. The contents of which more and more discourages me from talking to anyone about it lest I provoke bad reactions. Of course, what I have learned is that this is the best version of the world we have. Everything that's called evil is necessary. Everything that's called good used to be a former evil. And above all, philosophy is dangerous and should be concealed from almost everyone and it is.</p>
<p>Philosophy is not really possible today, especially within our educational institutions which are devoted to making money. Even the students only ever pursue <q>higher education</q> for money in their belief that having higher education credentials ensures higher paying careers, the truth of which doesn't matter, the fact is: nobody pursues higher education for higher education in itself, especially when the price is steep. What's worse is that some people believe that increasing funding to higher education or giving more people the opportunity to have a higher education will somehow improve society. It seems to me that unless they are sucked in to spend the rest of their lives there, people come out of college stupider than when they came in. So increasing funding to higher education will make that worse. If having higher education is not actually destroying our minds and it really does benefit us in ways that go beyond the artificial view of the value of a diploma, then most of that money certainly doesn't go towards things that benefit students unless it helps the university make even more money; otherwise that money will go towards: more dorms for students to rent, more parking spaces for students to rent, more on-campus stores for students to buy things from, more on-campus restaurants so that students will spend more of their lunch money inside campus, these are the most important things to spend money on: things that make more money. Secondary things include: more surveillance cameras, more television screens for the offices, as well as some nice upholstery and fresh carpeting, but only for the administrative offices and not for the classrooms.</p>
<p>Meanwhile you might see some professors who complain about not being paid enough, but they have tenure so what they end up doing is not giving a butterfly about presenting decent lectures and they never get reprimanded because they have tenure. Then you have hard working adjunct professors who try their hardest which might seem like a good thing until you realize that they don't know that much more than your average graduate student so they end up giving lessons that lack quality even if they have good intentions. Then you have the general education classes, all of which are glorified flash card games from a powerpoint presentation, everything is watered down.</p>
<p>It is impossible to learn anything with all the careless tenured professors, uneducated untenured professors, and the decadent students that come in several flavors: the social status climbers who will do anything to look better than others without actually accomplishing or learning anything but by simply networking and asking favors for nothing in return while not caring about anyone but themselves, the drug and sex addicts, the straight A students who can only memorize large amounts of information without understanding any of it and then forgetting everything they memorized when they don't need to memorize it anymore, the rich foreign-exchange students who cheat on tests and pay for others to do their homework.</p>
<p>Those who seek true education are forced to create off campus secret clubs where they study real texts and have real discussions out of the view from the finger-wagging, New York Times-reading academics. I once had an in-class argument with a professor who literally claimed that you can convince a toddler to feel pleasure from exposing his hand directly to an open flame because of the idea that pleasure and pain are <q>socially constructed</q>. I ended up flunking that class, good for me. Students who end up learning from people like this end up in creative writing classes where I get to listen to their bullshit as they recite their essay in front of class. If their essays do not end up being an unintelligible hodgepodge, they are at best crude paraphrases of what they remembered from the opinions of one of their humanities professors. Essays shouldn't really be written by students, they should be written by people who have real opinions and real arguments and who can write properly. Asking a student to write their opinion when they don't know anything will yield random results. Asking a student to write anything when they don't know how to write or even speak properly is a great way to accelerate the break-down of language and the use of emojis. Students should be reading a lot more than they write, and they should be reading works of great writers and thinkers, not textbooks written by textbook companies. But we are lucky if they even read textbooks if professors just base the entire course off of powerpoint slides and bullet points, or even worse: movies and documentaries and news articles. At this point there is nothing that you can learn in college that you can't learn from the internet. But then again, learning is not why people go to college.</p>
