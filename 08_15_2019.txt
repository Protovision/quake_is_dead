<h1>Social Factories</h1>
<p>A year ago, I wrote an essay for an English class. It may seem overly structured (such as the pointless introduction or the forced inclusion of references) but it was part of the requirements. I wish to share that essay here. We were supposed to pick an issue and write about it. You would be surprised how rare an opportunity, to write about anything one wishes, comes up. Usually the issue to write about is restricted in scope to something that the professor wants and restricted in method and conclusion to what the professor wants. I take the liberties here to write about social media and news and it's effects on worldview. This essay was originally written on March 2, 2018. Forgive me for the awkward writing, I was and am still developing my writing style.</p>

		<p>It does not take an expert to see the destructive force of social media. Even though there are daily news headlines that bring up the detrimental effects of social media, one does not need to read or watch the news to be aware of this apocalypse when one can see it in one's everyday dealings. One does not need to own any type of internet-enabled device to see how others shut themselves off from a meaningful reality in exchange for a false, digital world viewed through a tiny screen. There is much that ha been said about this universally understood problem; it has served as a catalyst for discussion among scholars and non-scholars.</p>
		<p>It is important to give a definition for social media before diving into an analysis of it's effects on one's world view. The definition given by Google search engine is &ldquo;websites and applications that enable users to create and share content or to participate in social networking.&rdquo;, we shall take this as the definition. Let's note a few things from this, the definition is given as a noun in the plural for, indicating that "social media" is not one thing, but a totality of related things. What all these things, websites and applications, have in common other than that they are software is that they enable people to interact with each other across the Internet.</p>
		<p>Our current technology enables this interaction to take on visual, auditory, and, more recently, tactile forms. While user interaction is thematic for social networks, a website or application can still be a part of social media without being a social network. Another common form of social media are news websites that enable users to leave comments under an article; to many, these types of websites appear more trustworthy than social networks for one to become informed even though users have less of a voice on a news website than on a social network.</p>
		<p>This trust of news websites is based on a trust of the expertise of those who prepare the news, the journalists; and it is from these peoeple that the world view of the average person is shaped. While journalism is meant to inform people of current events and ideas, it does so in a way that either upholds the status quo or challenges it; what is more recently coined as &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; is the latter. Since what is presented in the news is a large part of the average world view, and the average world view is the status quo, the status quo is, for a large part, established by journalists; and, like most experts, they will uphold and maintain what they establish.</p>
		<p>What gets established by experts are known as facts. The current definition of <i>fact</i> is &ldquo;a thing that is indisputably the case.&rdquo;, thus whatever experts establish becomes indisputable. Any news that attempts to dispute what is deemed indisputable is branded as fake news, any science that attempts to do the same is branded as psuedoscience which means fake science. The type of experts knowns as Journalists do not usually establish facts in a formal sense; instead they, as well as social networks, partake in an activity knowns as &ldquo;fact-checking&rdquo;. While the establishing of fact is a positive attempt to expand the status quo, fact-checking is a negative action aimed at enforcing the status quo by either attacking or concealing the opinions of those who challenge it.</p>
		<p><i>Fact</i> originates from the Latin word <i>factum</i> which means &ldquo;an act or feat&rdquo;, it's multiple earlier definitions from 1913 Webster include &ldquo;A doing, making, or preparing&rdquo; and &ldquo;An effect produced or achieved; anything done or that comes to pass; an act; event; a circumstance&rdquo;. The synonyms of <i>fact</i> include: <i>reality</i>, <i>actuality</i>, and <i>truth</i>.</p>
		<p>The phrases that usually preceed an assertion, those being: &ldquo;In fact, ...&rdquo;, &ldquo;Actually, ...&rdquo;, and &ldquo;In truth, ...&rdquo;, are all equivalent because there is a temporal conception of truth here. Truth is conceived as actions or events which are assumed to be products of matter and time. <i>Matter</i>, when used in phrases such as &ldquo;matter of fact&rdquo; and &ldquo;fact of the matter&rdquo;, point to a bireciprocal relationship between fact and matter. The word <i>of</i> means &ldquo;belonging to or proceeding from&rdquo;, so if &ldquo;matter of fact&rdquo; and &ldquo;fact of the matter&rdquo; means that <i>fact</i> belongs to <i>matter</i> and <i>matter</i> belongs to <i>fact</i>, then it's derived that <i>fact</i> and <i>matter</i> are one and the same. In those phrases, <i>matter</i> is defined as &ldquo;subject of action&rdquo; or &ldquo;subject of discourse&rdquo;. <i>Subject</i> is composed of <i>sub</i>, meaing &ldquo;under&rdquo;, and <i>ject</i> meaning &ldquo;brought, thrown, or casted towards&rdquo (used to construct the words <i>inject</i> and <i>eject</i>); but we already know that <i>fact</i> as <i>factum</i> means action and <i>discourse</i> is also an action that leads to deliberate action, so in the definition of <i>matter</i> it is asserted that <i>matter</i> is subjected to <i>fact</i>.</p>
		<p>The subjection of <i>fact</i> to <i>matter</i> can be articulated when <i>matter</i> is traced to it's older form <i>materia</i> which means <i>substance</i>. The modern usage of <i>substance</i> is related to the usage of <i>matter</i> as additionally defined as &ldquo;mass occupy space&rdquo;. With this definition, the phrase &ldquo;the fact of the matter&rdquo; makes sense when translated as &ldquo;the action of the mass occupying space&rdquo;. The phrases &ldquo;That doesn't matter&rdquo; is equivalent to it's more formal phrase &ldquo;That doesn't hold weight&rdquo; where the latter phrase is used when discussing facts. Phrases like &ldquo;That article is <i>dense</i>&rdquo;, &ldquo;The <i>cornerstone</i> of this theory ...&rdquo;, &ldquo;The <i>bulk</i> of this research lies in ...&rdquo;, &ldquo;That was a <i>solid</i> argument&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Take a <i>firm</i> stance on this issue&rdquo; all reveal a physical conception of <i>subtance</i> as <i>matter</i> (<i>materia</i>), <i>matter</i> as the <i>actual</i> (<i>actualis</i>), the <i>actual</i> as the <i>real</i> (<i>realis</i>), the <i>real</i> as <i>fact</i> (<i>factum</i>), and <i>fact</i> as <i>truth</i>.</p>
		<p>In the usage of law, an <i>act</i> is a law or decree established by a legislative body, it is also the exercise of power since law constantly maintains and manifests itself through it's enforcement by an executive power.</p>
		<p>Since laws or <i>act</i> determine what is to be done by <i>subject</i> of the law, and what gets done affects matter (the mass in space around us), and matter (as mass occupying space) constitutes the physical environment that people live under, and this physical environment affects &ldquo;what matters&rdquo; (<i>matter</i>, this time as something concerned for), and these matters of concern affect discourse of law, then the conception brought forth from &ldquo;fact of the matter&rdquo; and &ldquo;matter of fact&rdquo; as &ldquo;fact is matter&rdquo; is casually reinforced.</p>
		<p>Facts are commonly understood to exist as scientific facts or scientific laws. Scientific laws are not created by legislative bodies, instead they are created by certain scientific bodies belonging to what is known as the &ldquo;scientific community&rdquo;, other scientific bodies are known as psueoscientists. In whatever context or region facts are made, they all make up a totality of a view of the way things are and the way things relate to each other: this toatlity is the world view of the status quo: the current state of affairs.</p>
		<p>In accordance with certain earlier understandings as well as certain modern interpretations, facts are not found or discorvered, they are created and enforced, affecting the world and the people that they are enforced on. These two apparantly conflicting ideas of fact can be reconciled if it is understood that the creating and enforcing of fact is not done by humans but it is done by a higher power.</p>
		<p>In any interpretation of fact, it is understood that going against fact or law has consequences. In earlier times, these consequences could include torture at the stake and damnation in hell. Today, these consequences include a tarnished online reputation which can spill over into losing one's job and one's friends. But there is no difference here, in whatever era, one will be shunned by the community for challenging fact or law.</p>
		<p>With this better understanding of the meaning of fact, the phrase &ldquo;fact-checking&rdquo;, which governments and their benefactors have been trying to exalt and execute onto people and social media, should now sound more conspicuous.</p>
		<p>In November after the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Mark Zuckerberg; co-founder, chairman, and CEO of the popular social network Facebook; responded to accusations of fake news on his platform incluencing the outcome of the election: &ldquo;Voters make decisions based on their lived experience...There is a profound lack of empathy in aaserting that the only reason someone could have voted the way they did is because they saw fake news&rdquo;.</p>
		<p>Initially, Zuckerberg not only dismissed notions of fake news on his platform but also pointed out that the ones making these accusations have a lack of empathy for people who voted for the current president. Perhaps these words do not reflect Zuckerberg's genuine opinion, he could have simply been trying to protect the reputation of his product. what zuckerberg said could very well be true and that even the whole concept of fake news could be a fabrication of mainstream media. Regardless, even if there actually was so called Russian-propagated fake news on Facebook and other social media, and even if this fake news influenced voting decisions, no laws were broken and the process of voting still operated lawfully.</p>
		<p>Zuckerberg's reaction to these accusations fell back into line when pressure from governments, media, celebrities, and political interests closed in. Nearly a month later, Facebook began working with journalists to fact-check, flag, and hide posts considered to be unfactual. The fact-checking groups that Facebook initially worked with included: ABC News, Politifact, FactCheck, and Snopes. During the same year, German legislators have threatened Facebook with fines for not removing fake news and hate speech fast enough within the country, especially hate speech in regards to mass migration of refugees at the time. Fake news has also been blamed for the unexpected democratic result of Brexit, the referendum for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. British members of parliament have recently been forming committees dedicated to inquiting towards a solution for stopping fake news on social media under the guise of protecting democracy.</p>
		<p>Very recently, video sharing platform, Youtube has begun removing videos posted by independent commentators, especially videos that commentate about recent mass shooting events in a way that is classified as spreading fake news. The blogging platform, Medium, has done the same with an updated policy that reserves them the right to remove your account even for things you do offline while not using their product at all, which they call &ldquo;off-platform activity&rdquo;. Facebook has temporarily banned a number of women for saying &ldquo;men are scum&rdquo; as it violates Facebook's hate speech policies.</p>
		<p>The battle for maintaining the current system of facts and more primodrially the concept of truth as fact shapes the world view of each person. The heightened interest for speech restriction on social media after the occurrence of significant political events indicates a fear of change in the political world order: it amounts to a fear of the people, the majority, since they are the ones who actually work and produce without which there is no life.</p>
		<p>The question of who has the most influence on social media and what message they are trying to propagate is of another concern. What is known, regardless of one&rsquo;s level of faith in today&rsquo;s journalists, is that social media is a powerful tool for propaganda. Although it has not been around for long, the Internet is proving to be as impactful as the printing press in the development of political life and culture throughout history. There will always be problems, of course, in the dissemination of false information and social media is one of the many mediums this takes place in. The more obvious and readily identifiable problem with social media is it&rsquo;s ability to damage both one&rsquo;s attention span and one&rsquo;s relationships with others.</p>
		<p>Whereever one gets one&rsquo;s news from, even if it&rsquo; branded as fake news, periodically one will encounter an article talking about the negative effects of social media and it will be written by or referenced to a psychologist. The more peculiar articles about the risks from social media to our mental health are the ones quoting former-founders and former-chairment of current popular social networks who have become disillusioned with what they have had a hand in creating.</p>
		<p>Evan Williams, Former CEO of Twitter, has said &rsquo;There is a media ecosystem that is supported and thrives on attention, period. And that is what&rsquo;s making us dumber and not smarter&rdquo;. Sean Parker, cofounder of Napster and former president of Facebook, has said &rdquo;The thought process that went into building these applications, Facebook being the first of them ... was all about: &lsquo;How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?&rsquo; ... God only knows what it&rsquo;s doing to our children&rsquo;s breains ... It&rsquo;s a social-validation feedback loop ... exactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with, because you&rsquo;re exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology&rdquo;. Chamath Palihapitiya, former Facebook executive, expressed &ldquo;tremendous guilt&rdquo; for helping startup Facebook: &ldquo;I think we have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works&rdquo;, later referring to these tools as &rdquo;The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops&rdquo;.</p>
		<p>There have been many mental health studies that conclude that heavy users of social media have higher rates of depression, anxiety, impulsiveness, inattentiveness, there have also been too many instances of suicide showcased on social media. To list a few: Ayhan Uzun, live-streamed his suicide with a gunshot to the head after his daughter got married without his permission, russian blogger Arslan Veleev live-streamed his suicide by a poisonouse snake bite after a marital breakdown, 14-year-old Nakia Venant live streamed her suicide by hanging herself in a bathroom, 12-year-old Katelyn Nicole David live streamed her suicide by hanging from a tree after being sexually abused by a relative, 11-year-old Tysen Benz committed suicide after his girlfriend played a prank on him using social media, leading him to believe that she committed suicide. There are many more online suicides that have not been mentioned here.</p>
		<p>Humans are naturally lonely and they desire human contact. The creation of social media could at bottom be an attempt to eliminate this natural and everyday state of mind. It is evident that this has not been the case and that people are not only lonelier but more hostile towards each other in today's politcal-technological environment. You would think that with the power of instant communication that social media would helpe disclose genuine human expression, it has done the opposite by making people feel afraid of not constantly being sanctimoniously secular. concern for things and concern for people, which are essential to being human, are not only eliminated but conceptually obsolete if the hazily and misguided vision of the perfection of social media comes to pass, at which point: people will always be connected with each other and no information about anything or anyone will be out of reach. With the elimination of privacy and the exploitation of solicitude, everyone will comport oneself, not to anyone in particular, but to the average person who does not exist but is fabricated by the current state of affairs; as a consequence, each genuine individual is eliminated. This recurrent process enlargens the average and lowers the person so that what is left of the person is indistuinguishable from the mass occupying space, at this point <i>concern</i> is an impossibility because ther will be no one to do the <i>conerning</i> and nothing to be <i>concerned</i> about. Behavior that leans towards this possible future is today considered a virtue, it is called being <i>unbiased</i>: the defining quality of the professional: the model future citizen.</p>
