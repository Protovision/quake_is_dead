<p>The feasability of such a project, even if contained to a virtual world is prone to failure. It's success would most likely grow out of the cultivation maintained by the combined effort of many games over many gaming generations. The industry itself has no direction and is in an internal and eternal war of copying trends and cookie cutting quality for the quantity of profits, their foresight and their cooperation in anything for either their own good or the good of the players is highly doubtful. The value of it all if somehow successful? Questionable, not only to it's sustainability but also to whether this is even the true result of the culmination of strength.</p>
<p>This philosophy of the future as put forth by Nietzsche in the 1880's is an attempt to both reject the weakening of society while redeeming it through the hope that it will serve a greater purpose beyond any of the purposes it sets for itself. Equality in the pessimistic sense is the leveling down of all members of society, all responsibility for one's actions, all expectations of honor, of willful obedience in times of necessity and in the presence of great men, of will in anything at all for one's self as well as great passions and great creativity all go out the window when freedom and nature are rejected on the altar of a morality sees both as the root of all evil.</p>
<p>Equality, not as a means to end all oppression, nor as a literal end in itself, but as a means to raise and strengthen the average individual so as to strengthen the cohesion of one people who have a duty not only to each other but also to themselves and their loved ones all while having a private life and setting and maintaining individual goals is the optimistic American-style equality.</p>
<p>Despite Nietzsche's critique of the anti-naturalness of all previous philosophers, of their cunning rejection of what is actually good for the human species as such in favor of raising to moral standards their own personal decadence, the advocation of a great split of humans into a world government where superhumans herd and enslave subhumans is actually more anti-terrestial, than the rest of the doctrines. Whether it was a prescription or a prediction, it is happening. Philosophy and religion are dangerous in that they would seem to benefit extra-terrestial colonizers who implant false doctrines into a people at the start of their development and come back many millenia later when those doctrines come to bear fruition: where earthly humans are either dead or docile enough for enslavement and planetary resources can be harvested.</p>
<p>One or Two things every spiritual or political doctrine neglects: the preservation of the body or the preservation of the environment. Body is replaced by spirit and environment is replaced by technology. In both cases, the latter is seen as more refined and more perfect than the former, so perfect in fact, that it may serve as a replacement for both (the spirit replacing the body and the spirit world replacing the environment; or an artificial environment or simulation replacing the natural environment and a completely robotic or virtual body replacing the body of flesh and blood). Advocates of the one or the other (body or environment) reject or forget about the other, both are necessary for human development. There is no proof, neither will there ever be proof of any spiritual realm or the universe as a computer simulation. Living for a pipe dream that may not even be yours is a sign of weakness and of a compromised will. Allusions to divine inspiration or philosophical enlightenment from 'spirits' or 'daemons' may very well be contacts from other earthly humans of technological or evolutionary superiority. Their psychological dominance is in our languages and symbols, there is no truth accessible to us outside the basis of all thinking and communication: Heidegger understands this better than any of us.</p>
<p>It does not make sense how the future &ldquo;lords of the earth&rdquo; can design a system where the greatest individuals rise from and depend on the breeding of the weakest and stupidest humans of world history. Such a foundation, no matter how limitless, would be utterly useless for any means at all, they would be like parasites, never satisfied from hunger. No technology or drug would be able to sustain them, let alone have them be of any use to a Ceasar. A system that depends on maximum inequality is fragile on both ends of it's heirarchy, it's longevity is doubtful. The middling class is what keeps the tyranny of boths ends in check, a middling class can exist modestly on it's own without the need to command or be commanded; without their temperence and unifying gravity, there is no limit to the distance between the highest and lowest members of society, there is no society at all: only nameless, invisible commanders commanding the majority of what's left of the human animal, something that will be more shameful than whatever we have today. Humans are not progressing, we are becoming sicker, weaker, less attentive, less fertile, more depressed, more dependent on drugs, more suicidal, and perhaps by design? What use are we to become for the grand scheme of world government bureaucrats if not just to be victims of scientific experiments or genocide with no redeeming product because the projects fail?</p>
<p>Contrary lesson: The superhuman was always impossible and should not be tried. Every affirmative doctrine set forth in his writings were nothing more than thought experiments. The proof of the insanity of applying some of them were not only already demonstrated in history after his death, but he predicted it too. The superman is just another representation of christ and all the evil that was done in his name. The last man was more of a prediction that later became rationalized into a prescriptive means to the superman, with all his pride in his menial things and all his concern with the large things and his belief in his own height and ambition in the land of the shire. And this is really all that exists today, last men who feel empowered by gathering attention to themselves while stealing attention away from others. Last men who love to hate while reversing the value of every word and claiming a historical victory over it, claiming victory over history itself. </p>
<h2>Purposelessness. Salvation or damnation?</h2>
<p>All of this writing is out of order. Just the disorganized scribbles of a whatever passes by me. I write to leave a bread trail in this darkest of woods, deepest of caves. What does the last-man and the over-man have in common? They acknowledge purposelessness. Whereas in one, it may seem to entail eternal damnation, even a provacation to suicide while in the other it entails the ultimate redemption and freedom from all restraints. Scholars have known that the eternal return is the self-diagnosis of one's life and perhaps a more modern, colder, more honest version of carpe diem. Has the following feeling been raised as an additional implication of either nihilism or eternal recurrence: that fear is eliminated.</p>
<p>What do the pious say at great events, both good and bad? There is a purpose behind this. The men of the past have always sought purpose behind all events, clinging on to it even in the face of great evil. 'God allowed this to happen' 'for a greater purpose' they say. What do atheists say? 'There is no God...but there is still a purpose or cause or reasonable/scientific explanation behind this'. At least most atheists, the dishonest atheists will claim that. I will not raise the possible hypocrisy, the possible good that one does for evil when one insists in granting purpose, that is <i>value</i>, to phenomena that morally countradicts their faith, and if they have no faith then why comment on the matter at all? Why have uncontrollable emotional reactions to the event at all? Because you still believe in it's moral significance whether you admit it or not. When one eliminates the purpose for an event, by extension the <i>will</i> behind that event is also eliminated. What is scarier than a will that orchestrates all feelings of eminent danger? No will means no power, at least no directed power and hence no concentration of it towards a focal point and obviously no concentration of it from a source, only a random spark or wave of force brought on by nothing but perhaps the random discharge of energies in the surrounding area, but there is nothing that premeditated it and it is gone as soon as it started. Neither Yahweh nor Satan, nor Angel nor Demon, nor Ghost nor any kind of Spirit brought on the event because what else has been claimed the origin of unexplainable physical events? These entities are the most feared because not only do they have the passions for vengeance and every other spiteful thinking possessed by humans, but they more or less have the unlimited power to act on them while being invincible to any material weapon.</p>
<p>Nature is already inherently meaningless thanks to science. When the supernatural world is done away with, whatever purpose it provided to the natural world is also done away with along with the willing agents that came from there too. No will there and no will to be found here. What is there to fear when there is no one that has willed every harm brought on us? All of it were just accidental occurrences. Nothing becomes scary except our own stupidity.</p>
<p>Whereas the believers of the past needed to believe in some protector as the opposite of that unknown and scary will behind the evil that tries to destroy them, as a reaction to this belief; The first belief: the belief of the evil one first and the belief of the good one second as a reactionary form of comforting; this only adds complexity to the situation and more lies to cover up the first lie. Just eliminate both. In the case of events interpreted as evil with no apparant human cause, there is no need to imagine a superhuman cause: not the work of satan advancing evil and neither the work of yahweh advancing good in a way one cannot understand at the moment. No. The image of God and his angels, although conceived for comfort and protection, cannot provide enough comfort and protection because in the back of one's mind it is always known that the devil and his evil spirits are always still alive and at work here on earth while the good spirits are much farther away from us. Why? Because of a contradicting belief: the world as evil. History as evil. What is the reactionary added complexity to ameliorate this? That the world, both it's physicality and temporality are temporary, the obvious eternality of the earth as well as the themes of history are ignored for comfort. Truth is covered up for comfort, but that is not accurate to say. Lies opposite to the overreactions borne of weakness were created to psychologically soothe: to think happy thoughts in the face of fear, to cover ones ears and eyes and make noises so that the monsters stay away but this only really all makes it worse than growing up, confronting the fear and maturing past it, that is, to realize that there is <i>nothing</i> there.</p>
<p>To confront and accept the truth not only frees up one's anxieties, it saves one energy from needing to create and maintain more lies and imaginary worlds created to postpone the analysis of that which stroke the feelings of fear in the first place, that plus all the daily rituals and superstituious practices that come along with it. Humans do not want to confront their monsters, they want their teddy bears to come to life and fight the monsters off for them. These guardians or protectors, if not imagined, if actually real may well just be other terrestial humans whose intentions, either beneficial or harmful to us (most likely harmful, both physically and politically), do not add anything substantial to Nietzsche's predictions in the end. In the end, it is still humans invading or colonizing other humans. The physical features, skin color, number and size of limbs do not matter. An "alien" is still a "human" insofar as it has intelligence and some form of speech. But for these advanced humans, perhaps their speech is beyond good and evil and we are all the last-men. Global politics, although relatively new, will no longer be the grand politics of the era when interglobal politics becomes well known.</p>
