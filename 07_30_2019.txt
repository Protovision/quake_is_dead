<h1>Ecce Introductio Mea</h1>
<p>I have chosen the difficult path when it comes to online dating. Instead of generic and overused content,  such as: hiking, travelling, camping, going to concerts, &ldquo;going on adventures&rdquo;, &ldquo;having fun&rdquo;; I have decided to include strange but interesting writing to distinguish myself from others at the cost of scaring away most people. Most people do not have the time or the money to be travelling or going out all the time, most people's lives are boring but they lie about doing these things on their profile. I choose an interesting introduction over a generic and superficial one. On certain dating sites which have match questions, I do my best job on not answering specific questions that have incorrect answers which include any of the questions that deal with politics or religion. I sometimes think that these dating sites sabatoge people who answer certain match questions in ways that go against the company's biased agenda to prevent them from finding matches. For example, Okcupid has a question that says &ldquo;Do you support the ACLU?&rdquo; and if you answered yes to this, then your profile would display a badge that would say &ldquo;Right to Love&rdquo; as if this was the correct answer the whole time.</p>
<p>Look at Okcupid's <a href="https://theblog.okcupid.com/what-it-means-when-your-okcupid-match-has-the-aclu-righttolove-badge-184a209b6190">official blog post</a> on the matter. They say things like:</p>
<ul>
	<li><q>people on OkCupid who support the ACLU get 15% more likes, and have 10% more conversations, than those who donâ€™t.</q>. This is a threat. Assimilate or die alone.</li>
	<li>Supporters of ACLU are <q>25% more likely to have gone to graduate school</q>, conversely indicating that non-ACLU supporters are dumb and uneducated.</li>
	<li><q>4x more likely to consider themselves a feminist.</q></li>
	<li><q>2x more likely to say they could not date someone who didn't support the #metoo movement.</q></li>
	<li><q>2x more likely to say &ldquo;HELL NO&rdquo; to Trump</q></li>
	<li><q>70% more likely to say that traditional dating gender roles are outdated.</q></li>
</ul>
<p>Here's what they say about people who don't support the ACLU:</p>
<ul>
	<li>They are <q>7x more likely to think guns should always be allowed in schools</q></li>
	<li><q>2x more likely to say they don't enjoy travelling</q></li>
	<li><q>25% more likely to say they get short-tempered when stressed.</q></li>
	<li><q>4x more likely to have no LGBTQ friends</q></li>
	<li><q>30% more likely to be a compulsive neat-freak</q></li>
	<li><q>5x more likely to respond WHAT WAGE GAP? to &ldquo;Should we be fighting to close the gender wage gap?&rdquo;</q></li>
</ul>
<p>What an inclusive dating site, but it reflects the mindset of the majority of their users. How many people do you know who say any of the following: &ldquo;I would never date someone who is not pro-choice&rdquo;, &ldquo;I would never date a Trump supporter&rdquo;, &ldquo;I would never date someone who doesn't support #metoo or the women's march&rdquo;, &ldquo;I would never date someone who is not a feminist&rdquo;, &ldquo;I would never date someone who supports the NRA&rdquo;, &ldquo;I would never date someone who denies climate change&rdquo;, &ldquo;I would never date an anti-vaxxer&rdquo;, &ldquo;I would never date a republican&rdquo;, &ldquo;I would never date a Christian&rdquo;. Almost everyone would say yes to at least one of these. and Ironically, someone with so many of these deal breaker requirements are still more likely to find a date than someone who has none of these requirements for the other person.</p>
<p>If you use Okcupid and you don't want the algorithm to lower the visibility of your profile, if not out right shadowban, then you are required to answer Yes to the ACLU question as well as answering the following questions appropriately (boxed answers are the correct answers):
<!--Another question &ldquo;Do you think humans have enough respect for the Earth&rsquo;s other species?&rdquo;, the correct answer is obviously "No" because if you answer "Yes, too much" that automatically makes you an asshole and if you answer "Yes, about right" that makes you too moderate and it comes off as accepting the status quo not being able to think for yourself. Here are some other rigged questions that only have 1 right answer which you must choose otherwise you are automatically an asshole, the answers that are boxed are the answers that most people would accept regardless of their truth value.</p>

<p>Okcupid has a lot of purity litmus test questions to weed out the unacceptable people who should be shunned from society and blacklisted from all banks, restaurants, social networks, and commercial services while having their personal information and home address published in newspapers for as long as the government cannot legally do these things. And this is completely acceptable because it is legal and it serves the greater good of creating an all inclusive and accepting society where people get along and don't judge each other.</p>
<p>Those are the answers you should be placing or else you will be spotted out as a terrible person by both the website and it's members. Avoiding these questions if you have a different opinion does not help you much when someone is judging your profile.</p>
<p>Without further ado, this is what my dating profile says. Laugh all you want at it.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>I am a blend of artist, poet, scientist, musician, teacher, and philosophy. I am the wanderer out of the caves of light and shadow, the one who looks out with solitude into the abyss of the nighttime sea under the gaze of the stars. I am eternally becoming reborn, falling through fire and rising out of ashes with a new coat that makes me stronger, deeper, more colorful, and more complex each time. I am fire and dynamite and I am hammer and chisle.</p>
		<p>I am like a peacock. I have many eyes that have seen many truths. I retain all of them, no matter how contradictory, under my thick and colorful feathers. You may pluck them all you want but you will never find a cage that is large enough to contain me. I have flown, branch by branch, to the highest, coldest peaks where lightning strikes and avalanches begin. I have swam to the lowest depths where forgotten relics rest under watery graves.</p>
		<p>Love sends me to wonderful places. Come with me if my words have reached your soul.</p>
		<p>Listen to one of my journeys, it has made me appreciate heartbreaks and suffering:</p>
		<p>When love goes away, what follows is like an endless falling down into the depths of the sea. Gravity is heavier underwater. Your cries are not heard from the surface. As you fall deeper, things get darker and you encounter ever more uglier creatures of the deep.</p>
		<p>When you have reached the bottom, it is completely black and silent. You are now in the abyss, a place where things forgotten and things undiscovered remain concealed from the surface. It is a place of complete solitude where the deepest truths abude. You can finally hear your own thoughts.</p>
		<p>Eventually, there is a light at the bottom. From beneath the sand there is a glowing radiance. What is this? An underwater treasure? A door engraved with the message: &ldquo;Beyond this door is a kingdom where we dance instead of swim because our strength has overcome the force of every tide.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>It is sealed shut, you fail to open it. An anglerfish who carries his own light passes by and tells you &ldquo;You have found Atlantis but you cannot enter. Many have tried to open this door and steal the riches that lie within but each of them have died trying. If you don&rsquo;t believe me see their scattered notes and journals left behind.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>You tell the anglerfish, &ldquo;I am not looking for riches, I am looking for love.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>He replies &ldquo;Then swim back to where you come from, you will find love in the world you were cultivated in.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;But my world has no culture.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Then you must bring your world to this door. But you can&rsquo;t, because everyone who has tried has failed. Your only option is to love only yourself. That is the truth from the wisdom of your people. Until you are strong enough to love others, you can only love yourself; that is your only redeeming virtue. When you find the strnegth to love yourself again, you will be loved. But be careful not to let them know that you love yourself or they will exile you again and you will end up having this very same conversation with me as you did before. But I know you will fail and this will happen again.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>You reply &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way&rdquo;.</p>
		<p>The anglerfish smiles and says &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit!&rdquo;</p>
