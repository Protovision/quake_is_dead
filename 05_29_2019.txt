They are forms of anaesthesia which merely render the patient insensible to the pain of certain subseqeunt, fatal symptoms, without removing the morbid condition which causes them. They are often heroic measures taken to reduce the decadent man&apos;s <i>deleterious influence</i> to a minimum by subjecting him to a kind of quarantine.</li>

			<li>The <i>social problem</i> is a consequence of <i>d&eacute;cadence</i>.</li>
			<li>Diseases, most notably diseases of the brain and nerves, are indications of a constitutional lack of <i>resistance</i>, a sure sign of the irritability which regards <i>pleasure</i> and <i>pain</i> as paramount considerations.</li>

<p>It is an unfortunate fact that grinding, no matter how objectively pointless it is, is seen as meaningful and gratifying to the majority of players who cannot derive satisfaction naturally from their own improvement either because they are incapable of improving or because their self-esteem is non-existant and they require ever stronger stimulants and psychological feedback loops to satisfy their cravings for instant gratification generated by a life and culture shaped by social media.</p>
<p>Successful games all have some form of grinding that never ends and has a small reward every 10 feet, this is a psychological need for low-skill and low-attention-span players. The free-spirited players who have no desire or care for this, are perfectly capable of feeling their own natural improvement and distinction from the rest of the players; they do not care much about quests, loot, levels, or titles as long as these things are cosmetic-only and do not affect the core gameplay. When people complain that a game lacks giving players a &ldquo;sense of pride and accomplishment&rdquo;, they are speaking for their own needs and the needs of the herd. Many people need to have a reason to grind above all other reasons to play the game, they care more about this than game balance, matchmaking, or bug fixes. To them, it is not about the game play, it is about the rewards.</p>
<p>This is an unhealthy need that breeds more unhealthy players, but it is required for the game to survive and thrive. For the accomplished players on the other hand, one should be careful in giving them exclusive rewards that can only be obtained through skill and not through grinding or spending money, or else the grinding players will complain about be excluded.</p>
<p>An endless artificial progression system through constant rewards and a constant flow of cosmetics are required to keep the majority of players addicted to the game. The need for a never-ending stimulus can and does easily overflow into the territory of game balance and matchmaking balance where these players also need low-skill champions and weapons that practically play themselves as well as a matchmaking system that grants them free wins periodically.</p>
<p>This is where the needs of the unskilled players come in contradiction with the desires of the skilled players. Skilled players desire fair and balanced game play, but this cannot be achieved without killing and bankrupting the game.</p>
<p>Unbalanced game mechanics for unskilled players exist to raise their minimum lethality to make them able to defend themselves against skilled players. Placing a cap on the maximum lethality of these kinds of mechanics makes it powerless against the strongest players and goes against the reason why the mechanic was introduced in the first place. The players who do end up suffering are the middle-skilled players, for they will lose to lower skilled players who use that mechanic and they will lose to high-skill players because of lack of tools to defend themselves against them. What ends up happening is that the game has many unskilled players and few high skilled players and zero middle-skilled players.</p>
<p>At this point, the high skill players will leave the game since they constantly find themselves on teams with unskilled players who are a burden to themselves and others and cannot be carried. The only players left are the grinders.</p>
<p>This may actually be the goal of many games that only exist to make money, as long as grinders keep grinding and they pay for items that can't be grinded for and as long as new content keeps getting released the game will survive and make money. But esports and entertainment for the spectator is completely out of the question since there are no players left that can demonstrate skill and there is no soil left to cultivate them from.</p>
<p>The question now is, is it mathematically possible to give the lowest skilled players at least a 50% winrate while allowing the skilled players to naturally exceed this winrate at levels proportional to their skill?</p>
<p>I have veered off topic and these questions on game balance and winrates should be investigated later.</p>
