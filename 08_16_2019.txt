<h1>The Moral authority behind Science and the State</h1>
<p>This is another essay I wrote in school. The class was an introductory philosophy class about religion, so I was required to write an essay relating to religion.</p>

		<p>Our world, understood by many to be coming into full realization as advancements in science and progress in social affairs continue their journey away from the old regime of religious dogma and into the new regime of a fundamentally new secular understanding, is a deception in the face of the reality of the transformation and the strengthening of religion into something completely unseen yet more powerful with it&rsquo;s imperatives that drive the direction of science as human knowledge and politics as human deliberation and action. The forces of religion, science, and the state; perceived as separate, are in actuality organized in layers by their scope, power, and authority. Science is a function of the state and the state is a function of religion. Religion is the first and final commanding force of every human thought, activity, and judgement. The separation of any one from the other tww is nothing more than a semblance, as so any conviction that one individual is free from the cause of these things.</p>
		<p>Let&rsquo;s clear away the current notions of these forces no matter how serious one of these is perceived as the most relevent while not taking the others seriously. Sciecne is not merely natrual science (or <i>hard science</i>), yet it is the first thought of many who are awe-struck by it&rsquo;s evidential power to alter matter. Science is knowledge. Anything that is currently claimed to be known is also claimed to be a part of science. Those whose occupation is to contribute to science have no real authority, not even over themselves, because science itself gives no commandments and does not assert any purpose to any state of affairs that it interprets. Religion has done a good job at making itself appear weak and stupid while masking it&rsquo;s true command and influence, the scientist is seen as the most respectable human and even the politician is more respected than the priest. Science, however, is the weakest force, it is not a force at all since it wills nothing at all, thus an administration can never establish it&rsquo;s ends out of science (it can, hewever, establish it&rsquo;s means towards it&rsquo;s ends out of science). A scientist is a machine and bookkeeper, void of spirit, and autonomous only while his assigned procedures branch into several subprocedures but otherwise motionless and lifeless like a tool stored away in the shed until the next task is given by the higher command. Every science that is not of political or religious authority operates within the economic and political control of the state and within the moral framework of the state&rsquo;s religion.</p>
		<p>This simple insight of the inferiority of what we today know as science to the science of the state and it&rsquo;s management is laid out elegantly by Aristotle:</p>
		<figure>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Knowledge of the good would seem to be the concern of the most authoritative science, the highest master science. And this is obviously the science of politics, because it lays down which of the sciences there should be in the cities, and which each class of person should learn and up to what level.</p>

		<p>It is true in the most practical sense that the science of policy determines the existence of any lower science ranging from the social sciences to the natural sciences and from the gay sciences to the dismal sciences. The state alone grants legitimacy to all forms of knowledge by ordaining each of them as an official profession, stamping the entries of their records with the seal of <i>fact</i>, and granting their practitioners with the license and title of <i>expert</i>: the title of nobility in postmdernity; a well-deserved status that commands trust and obedience from the rural and the uneducated basket of deplorables whose votes are illegitimate because they are all misinformed by fake news which must be blocked and deleted from all websites to ensure that people are properly informed on who to correctly vote for and the election results will be more favorable next time because only the most qualified candidate with the most experience should win, regardless of false opinions. This is why it is beneficial and it is the case that every branch of knowledge is a pseudoscience until politically authorized for it&rsquo;s public use in furthering the ends of the state. The ends of the state are of the highest altruistic good since it is historically-eveident that only the state can provide every citizen with a stable job and a living wage while privately-owned megacorporations today are replacing human works with robots.</p>
		<p>The altruism of the state was not developed internally on it&rsquo;s own, it is guided by the newst dominant denomination of a new form of christianity that has evolved to adapt with our ever more progressing historical context: secularism. The only rational religion where God is dead and whose worship is replaced with the worship of being and time. It&rsquo;s greatest disciples are the globally-minded, universal class of educated and impartial public servants who know how to best tackle today&rsquo;s economic, environmental,and social inequalities. One would have to embark on a marvellous underground journey to some portal or time machine to be able to foil their plans.</p>
		<p>Secularism is the prevailing <i>ism</i> that rules every successful modern state. It is a stoic and sterilized form of Christianity. It almost requires no consious faith to be a part of because it&rsquo;s effects are almost everywhere such that to have a different faith, one would have to journey outside of civilization into the most remote mountains and speak to the individuals who live there. Secularism is powerful because it manages to combine faiths in two contradictory things: a faith in an external, predictable world that is knowable and governed by natural and unchanging principles: a faith in external truth; and a faith in the moral and intellectual superiority of the present to the past as well as it&rsquo;s necessary transformation and improvement through time.</p>
		<p>Like Christianity, Secularism sees the future as optimistic and it promises that things will necessarily get better. Like the Christian church that wishes to expand it&rsquo;s charity programs and receive more donations, the secular state wishes to expand it&rsquo;s welfare programs and receive more taxes. On the surface, the value of such actions is supposed to be for the benefit of the most people by seeking to extinguish poverty and suffering in order to eventually build a future where such things do not exist and everyone will be &ldquo;free&rdquo; and happy. While many people see Christians as conservative, this is only true from a fiscal standpoint. Most christians are apolitical: always busy and silent as world events pass by, fulfilling daily prayers and responsibilities to God and family, rarely voting. The Christians that are political are the secular christians: they are more dominant in their actions, wishing to change people&rsquo;s minds and change the world; the secular christians are more likely to vote, more likely to march and protest, and more likely to instill their political and moral messages in their occupational work and on their clothing, they are activists. While the apolitical Christian waits for God to bring about world peace and bring an end to all suffering, the political securlized christian engages in activism or terrorism to fulfill the same exact vision without beliving that a god will do it. while they see each other as enemies and one will call himself an atheist and the other will call himself a believer, they are both governed by the same moral principles and hence they are both under the rule of the same religion because the set of <i>thou shalt</i> commandments that pertain to moral principles come from religion only. Insofar as the christian believes that thoughts can be sinful, the atheist also believes that thoughts can be prejudiced and that this makes the whole person evil regardless of all the good works they perform: so the christian requires that this person take more hours in church service and the secularist requires that this person take more hours of diversity classes and sensitivity training to make certain that their faith isn&rsquo;t lacking.</p>
		<p>These &ldquo;thou shalt&rdquo; moral commands are echoed by their follwers, anytime someone begins a claim with &ldquo;we have a moral responsibility to...&rdquo; that means the argument is empty and they are simply echoing a commandment from their religion, even if they are secular it is still a religion insofar as moral imperatives govern their reasoning.</p>
		<p>The fact that everyone everyone from fundamentalist evangelical christians, to secular atheists, to even self-proclaimed satanists agree on the goodness of love, charity, honesty, education, peace, democracy, impartiality, and equality; and the badness of hate, greed, deceitfulness, violence, prejudiceness, and jealousy; this means that they are under the same moral regime and these people are not fundamentally different. It shows that it&rsquo;s not a matter of choice if one wants to be a christian or not, we are all christians at heart no matter what kinds of makeup or outfit we choose to wear, we can never get past the moral prejudices that are a part of our species. It&rsquo;s something that we&rsquo;sre born with. Political and religious labels mean nothing, we are all equal in what makes us happy and what we all ultimately hope for.</p>
		<p>Most atheists cannot get past these limitations either because they don&rsquo;s recognize them or they do but they are too weak and afraid to confront them. The one&rsquo;s that don&rsquo;s recognize them believe they have won an argument when they point to examples of scientific progress, each of which does not fundamentally change anything such as: the shape of the earth, humans having primates as physical ancestors, the age of the universe. None of these things have any effect on morality and justice. When all sorts of empiricists try to place their magnifying glass against everything in the name of a quest for truth, instead of accepting defeat when they run against something unanswerable, they claim the answer will be found eventually! A promise that never goes fulfilled just like God&rsquo;s Kingdom. Human knowledge has it&rsquo;s limits and to not respect these limits will destroy us when we attempt to jump over our own shadows.</p>
