<h2>Oppression through collective action</h2>
<figure>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Even when one has attained a certain degree of independence, one always wishes for more; a <i>differentiation</i> emerges according to degree of strength; the individual no longer regards himself as equal without further ado; rather, <i>he seeks out his equals</i> - he contrasts with others. Individualism is followed by the formation of <i>members</i> and <i>organs</i>; related tendencies consolidate themselves and become active as powers; and between these centres of power there arises friction, war, knowledge of respective strengths, counterbalancing, rapprochement and <i>establishment of reciprocity</i>. In the end, a <i>hierarchy</i> is established.</p>

<p>This hierarchy exists in multiplayer games as player squads, each one formed initially by individual players who wished to consolidate their powers with their equals for the sake of exercising a greater combined strength over other players. This hierarchy has, at the base of it's structure with the multitude of the smallest quanta of powers, the many individual players who have not yet embraced the effectiveness of collective power.</p>
<p>The strokes of fortune affect and enchant individuals more than groups, the non-explicit afterthought reason behind the formation of groups in a multiplayer game, where fortune has it's laws executed through a matchmaking algorithm, is to resist the woes of fortune. Increasing resistance to fortune is inversely proportional to increasing the effectiveness of one's will, that is, increasing one's overall measure of power. Since matchmaking cannot add or remove any players to a full squad and can only scavenge for players that play against that squad, a full squad of players reduce the maximum effect of fortune on the outcome of their matches by 50%. In addition to this, the equalness of the players in the full squad, because of an implicit understanding of one another's strengths and weaknesses, further amplifies their combined power by 50% of the remaining 50%; their winrates will typically meet or exceed 75% while they remain grouped.</p>
<p>A strict matchmaking system will detect a superabundance of power from particular groups that form and will bar them from playing, but this has never been done before to my knowledge. It almost sounds ideal when greater groups form and wage war against each other, leaving the freedom for associations to spring up and compete with each other sounds like a beautiful process that never ends in leading to stronger armies and more beautiful battles, but what often happens is that as soon as a stronger group is encountered the weaker group will lose their morale, give up, and break off. Not only the weaker groups, but more so the solo players will give up too when they encounter heavily coordinated and powerful squads that are so great that there is no battle at all, only an onslaught.</p>
<p>This process resembles the general process of all interacting entities. The general process is the gathering of power into a single body through the struggles and consolidations of smaller bodies of power; once achieved, the final product does not last long, it collapses in on it's own strength because it no longer has any smaller bodies to consume. What was previously taken in spews out in random directions and the whole process repeats.</p>
<p>For a multiplayer game, the unchecked growth of power through the arrangements and struggles between squads leads to the death of the entire player population. In aphoristic terms, the life of the game is nourished by struggle. Struggle happens between equals. Between unequals, there is no struggle for one side and there is no resistance from the other side.</p>
<p>If a multiplayer game is to go along with what is fair by conventional wisdom, then squads should be matched against other squads of the same size with no solo-queueing players on either team and solo-queueing players should be matched against solo-queueing players exclusively. Regardless of a game's player population, a squad should be prevented from queueing if no other squad of the same size and skill level is in the queue. Extending this rule to extremely gifted solo players would be logically consistent but it is so exceptional that the question can be postponed for now.</p>
