<h1>All is vanity</h1>

		<!--<p>That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past...</p>-->
		<p>For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.</p>

		<p>We no longer derive man from &ldquo;the spirit&rdquo; or &ldquo;the deity&rdquo;; we have placed him back among the animals. We consider him the strongest animal because he is the most cunning: his spirituality is a consequence of this. On the other hand, we oppose the vanity that would raise its head again here too &mdash; as if man had been the great hidden purpose of the evolution of the animals. Man is by no means the crown of creation: every living being stands beside him on the same level of perfection. And even this is saying too much: relatively speaking, man is the most bungled of all the animals, the sickliest, and not one has strayed more dangerously from its instincts. But for all that, he is of course the most <i>interesting.</i></p>

<p>Ocassionally I would be asked to expound on the &ldquo;skill&rdquo; that I wish to cultivate in a new competitive game. Here, and not for the sake of political correctness, do I consider skill not something that can be witnessed only in what is thought to be uniquely human qualities. The greatest forms of skill come from the most primordial, deep-seated instincts and impulses; they are the greatest examples of perfection and raw power: the ability to react with speed and precision, without any thought involved, against multiple stimuli. Conversely, the ability to focus on the eminent and most present at hand dangers while filtering out all noise so that the internal economy of energy is managed with maximum efficiency. Contemplation is the undoing of all that has been worked hard for over generations, it frees one from their natural talents and the safety of their natural biases and not without departing from bodily maintenance and awareness of time.</p>
<p>But every game requires that every competing party is in the same sphere of interaction which has a particular arrangement of time and space; regardless of one's perspective of the game, his or her actions must be in line with what can be observed and reacted to and all actions and effects must be thematic and exciting from the view of the spectators. Players and spectators cannot see one's thoughts even if one has enough time to think, actions must be the demonstration of player skill and they should constantly be in flux with other players' actions for a suspenseful battle. No action should be too powerful that it seals the fate of the game for most of the game's life time: this implies that logical actions should not reign supreme as much as they do in today's competitive games, otherwise the game will not be about skill but it will only be about knowledge which comes down to repeating the same algorithm every game because of it's high success rate. There is no skill involved in memorizing facts and directions and mindlessly performing them all the time like a robot. If anything, there should be a huge psychological element that diversifies what tactics are needed against certain opponents and eliminates the existence of power picks and trump cards that ensure victory, nothing should be ensured while the battle is being fought.</p>
<p>Man, unlike beast, is diversified in his masteries in relation to other men and even within each speciality there is a great variation of rank. Not a single one is operable on an independent level and yet society would rather have it otherwise by employing every means of collective action to achieve the most free individual when the actual human product, if realized, would have no reason to respect the rights or the culture of those who created him.</p>
<p>A game where all players start off equally and fight only for themselves presupposes a certain equality among them or at least a certain respect for their respective inequalities. Role playing elements both in aesthetics and game play design in a multiplayer environment represents the destruction of equality and self-sufficiency in favor of division of labor: where each player shares in extracting out of the work of others what one lacks. In practice, many people express frustration and feel there is an inherent unfairness to being used and treated as property of the team rather than a property exclusively to him or herself; conversely, players feel a right to the other players adhering to designated roles and will blame every defeat for other players failing to live up to this expectation (examples: blaming a defeat on the healers for not healing enough, the tanks for not capturing enough, the damagers for not dealing enough damage).</p>
<p>There is no way to go back to non-class-based, non-rpg shooters. This is not merely a trend, this is the necessary evolution of shooters and competitive games in general which mimics the game of life itself. A game whose effects on the individual are shared misery and shared oppression is an epiphenomenon with the leveling down of the average player through the destruction of median skill; it does not necessarily damage the growth of the greatest and most redeeming players, instead it could raise them higher and make them more concentrated into ever smaller individuals who build their power off of the work of the mass of role-designated players performing their respective singular tasks. This requires the acceleration of player inequality and the lowering of the barrier of entry to the game while raising the ceiling of greatness in an equal division.</p>
<p>Players who not only enjoy, but are only capable of playing a single role have their uses and their place in the game. Classes that are narrow, specialized, and easy for performing a single role exist for that. As the skill required for a class increases, so too does it's potential uses and roles open up and the more ambiguous the class becomes, the more of a hybrid class it takes on. This will result in players complaining out of the perception that these more skill-demanding hyrbid classes are underpowered when in actuality these players are not skilled enough to play that class. Their wishes should not be granted and the truth should not be made known to them, instead similar appearing classes that require less skill should be released to temporarily satisfy them.</p>
<p>To further make less skilled players less likely to use classes that are beyond their skill, cosmetics should be released for the easiest and most narrow classes while cosmetics for the classes designated for the greatest players should be rare, unappealing, and expensive. This happens naturally in many games where developers are not even thinking about this for the fact that players do not play characters that they consistently have bad experiences with while developers make cosmetics for the most played characters to increase profit, but here we add foresight to this for the sake of preventing less one-sided matchups caused by players using characters that they will never be able to effectively handle. Good players do not care about cosmetics, they will use whatever is most effective for them.</p>
<p>At this point, I seem to be rationalizing the absurdity of the direction of the shooter genre. Where what appears to be an influx of skillless and self-entitled rpg/anime lovers being catered to by profit seeking, privacy infringing developers, there may be a spontaneous order emerging from all this that will eventually result in a final redeeming product that justifies it all. Where I will be wrong is when the developers do everything they can to cap and quarantine the power of these redeeming players and level them down to the effectiveness of players many ranks below them for the sake of protecting the most prized sources of profit: protection of the herd not as a means for the game to survive and produce the greatest players but as an end in itself in conjunction with a notion of justice that grants to each inversely according to their ability and from each according to their wallet.</p>
