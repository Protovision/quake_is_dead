<h2>Governing players</h2>
<p>Between the clever and greedy AAA game companies and the naive and honest indie studios, we have either the capability but unwillingness to fairly govern players or a lack of awareness and understanding of the need for this. Resolving disputes and scandals between players should not be brushed aside in the pursuit of making money or making a fun game. Too often one bad player can end the match early for everyone and make hundreds of people uninstall the game if he is not dealt with.</p>
<p>The universally unacceptable player in any video game is the cheater who exploits the software of the game to give himself advantages such as wallhacks, perfect aim, and increased speed. If such a player manages to make it past any anti-cheat software undetected, they wreak havoc in many games for the rest of their days, weeks, or months before a human support technician can intervene and ban him. Such behavior must be dealt with immediately, waiting for enough reports to be sent on such a player prolongs the damage that he causes to the game and the community. Intervention from an impartial moderator or support member takes too long. Ban waves always come too late. The people who are directly affected by the cheater are the ones playing in the same match as him so they should have the responsibility of removing him.</p>
<p>Multiplayer Quake games have historically enabled the majority of players to vote on whether or not to kick a specific player off the server. It is a feature that every multiplayer game should have and despite it's potential abuses, it is necessary to prevent the greater evil of one player ruining the experience for everyone else. Implementation of this <q>callvote kick</q> feature must not be badly implemented. There is also a historical flaw with this feature in many Quake games and their clones. When badly implemented, if the player about to be voted off the server disconnects before the vote timer reaches 0, then the server cannot kick them because they are not present on the server anymore then the player can reconnect to the server as if they were never kicked. This simple flaw makes such a function useless because any player who knows about this flaw becomes immune to being vote kicked and a human moderator will be required to ban them first before kicking them. There are many solutions to this problem: the vote kick function should record that player's IP address and, if the vote passes, kick that player (if present) and temporarily ban him (whether or not he's present). The length of the temporary ban can be anywhere from 15 minutes to 24 hours. Vote kicking could require a common reason to be displayed to the rest of the player for the vote and the length of the temporary ban can be based off that reason. The system could issue a 15 minute ban for a player vote kicked for being AFK but a 24 hour ban for an aimbotter. Every instance of a vote kick, whether or not it passed should be recorded somehwere for the moderator to see it later.</p>
<p>A bad player who is persistent has ways of getting around this, they can make a new account and/or change their IP address. Solutions to this include: basing client identity off of a combination of IP addresses, email accounts, phone numbers, and operating system and hardware information. A ban should be as comprehensive in distinguishing the identity of players so as to prevent them from coming back.</p>
<p>There are usually three reasons to kick or ban a player: being AFK, cheating, or feeding. Feeding is the act of purposefully allowing enemies to kill you, this can be for many reasons. One reason to feed is to ruin the game for everyone else because of one's dissatisfaction with one's lack of skill, they think to themselves <q>I am not having fun because I'm a bad player. If I can't have fun then nobody else can.</q>. Another reason to feed is to boost the stats of a friend who is on the enemy team. Yet another reason to feed is to lower one's own stats so that the matchmaking algorithm can give them an easier game later on.</p>
<p>I can list several other forms of bad player behavior in a game, some of which other people would disagree that it is bad behavior especially if they themselves engage in it. As for the behavior that's universally agreed to be bad: feeding and cheating. Let the vote kick function resolve all such instances.</p>
<p>In short, the best way to govern players is to let them govern themselves.</p>
<h2>Cheating accusations</h2>
<p>Let all accusers step forth with their real identity and prove to everyone that so and so is cheating. Let the accuser reveal his name and let him point out the accused by name. If he does neither or one but not the other, he shall be banned. He shall also be banned for not providing sufficient evidence for his accusations, otherwise he shall be rewarded and the guilty punished. All this shall take place publically for every player to see and know about. There will be no confidentiality and no anonymous impartial observers.</p>
<p>The simple rules laid out in the previous paragraph should be enough to simultaneously deal justice to cheaters as well as deal justice to those who simply want to start quarrels and ruin someone's reputation. There must a forum where players can carry out their disputes with each other outside the game. Inside the game, if a swift decision cannot be made with a vote kick, players must have another place to vent their frustration and come to sensible agreements over a longer period. Too often moderators get in the way of resolving disputes and punishing the guilty, too often they end up protecting the guilty for stated reasons such as keeping the peace and protecting the confidentiality of every player.</p>
<p>Keeping the peace is precisely what elevates frustrations by keeping them from being discharged over time. Game companies that prevent this are either too lazy to have a part in resolving player disputes, too cheap to hire moderators to perform this task, or too cautious with getting sued in the real world.</p>
<h2>Monopoly servers</h2>
<p>Games with server browsers end up having a concentration of popular servers that are overly populated while the rest of the servers are empty. This naturally happens because people tend to join servers where everyone else is playing. Such servers are unfair to high ping players who have no other server to turn to. Take any shooter game with North American servers for example, they will rent the cheapest servers which are located in the worst part of the continent: Chicago. Everyone on the west coast will end up having over 100 ping in their own region. Southern and central players will have 50 ping and the minority of people who live in chicago and NYC will have less than 20 ping. Games with matchmaking queues seemingly solve this problem by not giving players a choice on which server to join and optionally hiding their ping, this creates more problems than it solves. The freedom to run a server wherever you want should not be taken away, but there should be a strong incentive to run a server in a location where the majority of players will have equal ping. A negative incentive would be introduce artificial lag to all players who have a significant ping advantage while leaving everyone else's ping alone, this still doesn't solve the problems that the highest ping players receive and of course this is a controversial solution that might not even work. A positive incentive would be rewarding premium in-game currency. It is traditionally the job of the game company to maintain servers at fair locations. The community can never ensure fairness in this scenario. But even then, how can one stop too many people from choosing to join a single server where all the activity is at?</p>
